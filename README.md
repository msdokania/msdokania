# Software Engineer | Full-Stack & Cloud

I’m a Software Engineer who enjoys building product-focussed systems from end-to-end. My focus is on building and scaling high-throughput distributed systems, resilient cloud infrastructure, and intelligent data platforms.

- Currently, I lead the end-to-end development of a React based distributed delivery platform from scratch - owning everything from backend services, microservices, APIs, infrastructure and AWS EKS orchestration using Terraform. I make core architectural decisions to ensure reliability, scalability, and performance at scale.

- Beyond core product development, I’ve built ETL pipelines to transform transactional data into analytics-ready datasets.

- My current obsession: Agentic AI. I’ve been experimenting with Actor-Critic models, feedback-driven memory loops, and self-correcting agents to move beyond standard applications toward truly autonomous systems.

- I like to build customer-centric products, and am motivated by ownership, an experimental mindset, and the challenge of building order out of technical chaos.
